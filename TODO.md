# SimplyJetpacks TODO List
This is a list of things I will have to change/do in the next time. This is just a temporary file as I will move this notes/issues
to a better system in the future.

- Make config update itself if I change the default values
- Do some nerfing to the Vanilla Jetpacks (e.g. default values, make it disable itself when other RF mods are present)
- Change textures of Fluxpacks (e.g. to fit the new EnderIO textures)
